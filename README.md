# 🔴 RedThread — Graph-Powered Financial Investigation Platform

**Discover hidden connections. Trace money flows. Map fraud networks.**

RedThread is an open-source investigation intelligence platform that uses graph database technology to help analysts uncover relationships that would be invisible in spreadsheets and traditional databases. Built on [FalkorDB](https://www.falkordb.com/) for lightning-fast graph traversals.

Think of it as the **detective's evidence board** — digitized, automated, and powered by graph algorithms that can find connections across 6+ hops in milliseconds.

---

## Why Graph?

**Before (spreadsheets & SQL):** An analyst manually cross-references 15 spreadsheets to find that Company A is owned by Trust B, which is directed by the same nominee who also controls Company C, which received funds that eventually reached the suspect's personal account. This takes **days or weeks**.

**After (RedThread):** Click "Find Hidden Connections" → instant visualization of a 4-hop money laundering chain through 3 shell companies across 5 jurisdictions. **Seconds, not weeks.**

The core insight: financial crime networks are **graphs** — people connected to organizations connected to accounts connected through transactions. Relational databases struggle with variable-depth traversals, cycle detection, and path finding. Graph databases make these operations native and fast.

## Features

### 🔗 Path Finding
Discover all connections between any two entities, from direct relationships to hidden 6-hop chains through intermediaries.

### 💰 Money Flow Tracing  
Follow the money through directed account-to-account transfers with amount aggregation — trace how funds flow and split across the network.

### 🔄 Circular Flow Detection
Automatically detect circular transaction patterns (A→B→C→A) — a classic money laundering indicator that's nearly impossible to spot in flat data.

### 🏢 Shell Company Chain Detection
Identify cross-jurisdiction corporate chains: Person → Company (BVI) → Trust (Cayman) → Subsidiary (Panama) — with automatic jurisdiction risk scoring.

### 💰 Structuring Detection
Find "smurfing" patterns — multiple transactions just below reporting thresholds — by analyzing transaction amounts across accounts.

### ⚠️ Risk Score Computation
Compute entity risk scores through network propagation: high-risk jurisdictions, connected suspicious entities, and transaction patterns all contribute, with risk diminishing by graph distance.

### 📊 Network Analytics
Degree centrality (most connected entities), bridge detection (entities connecting otherwise isolated groups), shared connections, and entity timelines.

### 🔍 Interactive Graph Visualization
Explore the network visually — click to expand, double-click to explore neighbors, drag to rearrange. Color-coded by entity type with risk-based sizing.

### 📁 Data Import
Import entities and relationships via CSV or JSON. Column mapping, validation, and entity resolution built in.

### 📋 Case Management
Create investigations, pin entities of interest, save graph snapshots, tag entities, and export reports.

### ⏳ Temporal Graph Analysis
All relationships carry `valid_from` / `valid_to` properties. Use the timeline slider in the UI to view the graph as it existed at any point in time, see what changed between two dates, and explore entity temporal profiles — understand when connections formed and dissolved.

### 📸 Graph Diff / Comparison Views
Take snapshots of the current graph state and compare any two snapshots (or current state vs. a snapshot) to find added/removed nodes and relationships. Ideal for tracking how a network evolves over the course of an investigation.

### 🗣️ Natural Language Query (LLM → Cypher)
Type questions in plain English — e.g. *"show me all money flows from Kovacs to accounts in Panama"* — and the system translates them to Cypher queries via an OpenAI-compatible API. Includes safety checks (read-only queries only) and graceful degradation when no API key is configured.

> **Note:** Natural Language Query requires an OpenAI-compatible API key set via `LLM_API_KEY`. The feature is optional — all other functionality works without it.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FalkorDB/RedThread.git
cd RedThread
docker compose up -d
# Seed with demo data:
docker compose exec app python -m src.seed
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Start FalkorDB
docker run -d --name falkordb -p 6379:6379 falkordb/falkordb:latest

# Install & run
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.seed      # Load demo data
make run                # Start server at http://localhost:8000
```

## Demo: Operation Crimson Tide

The seed data contains a realistic financial investigation scenario:

**The Case:** Viktor Kovacs, a former Minister of Infrastructure, is suspected of funneling €23M from government contracts through a network of offshore shell companies. The investigation reveals:

- **15 persons** including politicians, nominees, lawyers, and bankers
- **15 organizations** across 10 jurisdictions (BVI, Cayman Islands, Panama, Seychelles, Belize...)  
- **18 accounts** at banks worldwide
- **25 financial transfers** forming circular flows and structuring patterns
- **117 total relationships** in the network

### Try These Investigations:

1. **Search "Kovacs"** → Click to expand → See his direct connections to shell companies
2. **Click "🔍 Patterns"** → Discover circular money flows and structuring
3. **Select Kovacs → "Find Paths From" → Click an account** → See the money trail
4. **Select Golden Gate Holdings → "⚠️ Risk"** → See risk factors (BVI jurisdiction + high-risk connections)
5. **Double-click any node** → Expand its neighborhood to discover more connections
